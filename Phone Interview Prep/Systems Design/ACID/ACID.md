# ACID Transactions Explained

Imagine this: You're transferring money from your bank account to a friend.

You press "Send," and halfway through, your phone loses connection.

Did the transfer happen? Is your money stuck in limbo?

This is where ACID transactions come into play, ensuring that even when things go wrong, your data remains consistent, reliable, and safe.

ACID, an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, defines a set of properties that ensure database transactions are processed reliably.

In this article, we will explore each of these properties and their importance.

## 1. Atomicity

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit.

Either all steps of the transaction are completed, or none of them are.

If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is restored to its previous consistent state.

**Example:** You're transferring money from your bank account to your friend. Atomicity guarantees that either both your account is debited and your friend’s account is credited, or neither happens.

If something goes wrong during the transfer, no money will be deducted or credited.

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
If the second update fails, atomicity ensures that the first update is rolled back, maintaining consistency.

How Databases Implement Atomicity
Databases use various mechanisms to guarantee atomicity. One common method is logging—a transaction log (also known as a write-ahead log, or WAL) keeps track of all changes during a transaction.

If a transaction fails halfway through, the database consults this log and rolls back any incomplete operations.

Steps behind the scenes:

Begin Transaction: The system writes a "begin" entry to the log.

Execute Operations: Changes are made in-memory (debit your account, credit your friend's account).

Write to Log: The transaction writes all changes to the log, ensuring they can be rolled back if needed.

Commit: Once everything is successful, a "commit" entry is written to the log, making the changes permanent.

Rollback if Error: If there's an error, the system uses the log to undo any changes made.

## 2. Consistency
Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state.

It means that all the data integrity constraints, such as unique constraints, foreign key constraints, and check constraints, are satisfied before and after the transaction.

If a transaction violates any rules, it will not be committed, and the database will revert to its previous state.

Example: Consider a database with a constraint that account balances cannot be negative. A transaction attempting to withdraw more money than available will fail, preserving the consistency of the database.

Consistency in Distributed Systems
In a single database, consistency is often enforced through constraints and rules that are relatively simple to implement.

However, in distributed systems (where data is spread across multiple databases or regions), ensuring consistency can become more complex.

Strong Consistency vs. Eventual Consistency
In distributed databases like Amazon DynamoDB or Google Spanner, consistency can be more nuanced, especially when it comes to strong consistency vs. eventual consistency.

Strong Consistency: This guarantees that after a transaction, all users see the same data immediately. This is similar to traditional databases, where consistency is tightly enforced.

Eventual Consistency: In systems that prioritize availability and performance (e.g., distributed databases), data might take time to synchronize across multiple regions. Eventually, all nodes will be consistent, but in the short term, different nodes might see different versions of the data.

## 3. Isolation
Isolation ensures that transactions are executed in a way that they do not interfere with each other. It means that the intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions until it is committed.

Isolation prevents data inconsistencies that can arise when multiple transactions access and modify the same data simultaneously.

Isolation Levels:
Isolation comes with different levels, each providing a different balance between data integrity and performance.

Higher isolation levels provide stronger data consistency but can reduce system performance by increasing the wait times for transactions.

Let's explore the four common isolation levels:

Read Uncommitted: The lowest level, where transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.

Read Committed: Transactions only see committed changes made by other transactions, avoiding dirty reads.

Repeatable Read: Ensures that if a transaction reads a value, it will see the same value throughout the transaction, preventing non-repeatable reads.

Serializable: The highest isolation level, ensuring complete isolation by serializing all transactions.

Example: In a scenario where two transactions are updating the same record, isolation ensures that one transaction’s updates are not visible to the other until they are committed.

## 4. Durability
Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure. This means that committed data will not be lost.

This property guarantees that the results of a transaction are permanent and survive subsequent system failures, providing reliability.

Example: After a successful bank transaction, the updated balances should be stored permanently. Even if the system crashes immediately after the transaction, the committed changes will not be lost.

How Durability Works in Databases
Durability is primarily achieved by ensuring that the database writes committed data to non-volatile storage (storage that retains data even when powered off, such as SSDs, hard drives, or cloud storage).

There are two main mechanisms that databases use to ensure durability:

Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): Changes are first written to a log before being applied to the database. In the event of a failure, the system can use this log to replay the changes and recover the data.

Checkpointing: Periodically, the database writes all in-memory data to disk, ensuring that even if a crash occurs, the data is safe.

How do ACID Transactions Work?
Here's an example of how ACID transactions work:

Begin Transaction: A user initiates a transaction, such as transferring money from one account to another.

Execute Transaction: The database executes the transaction, performing the necessary operations.

Commit Transaction: If the transaction is successful, the changes are committed to the database.

Rollback Transaction: If an error occurs during the transaction, the database rolls back to its previous state, as if the transaction never occurred.

Databases implement ACID transactions through a combination of techniques, including:

Logging: Detailed records of all transactions are kept, allowing for recovery in case of a failure.

Locking: Data is locked during a transaction to prevent concurrent access and ensure isolation.

Two-Phase Commit: A protocol used to coordinate the commitment of a transaction across multiple systems.

Why are ACID Transactions Important?
ACID transactions offer several benefits, including:

Data Integrity: Ensures that data is consistent and accurate.

Reliability: Guarantees that transactions are processed reliably, even in the face of errors.

Security: Prevents data corruption and ensures that transactions are executed securely.

Performance: Improves performance by allowing concurrent transactions to occur without interference.

Practical Implementation of ACID Properties
Modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle implement ACID properties to ensure data integrity and reliability.

Here’s how these properties manifest in practice:

Transaction Management: Most databases provide SQL commands like BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK to manage transactions.

Locking Mechanisms: Databases use locks to manage concurrent transactions, ensuring isolation.

Write-Ahead Logging (WAL): Techniques like WAL ensure durability by writing changes to a log before applying them to the database.

Constraint Enforcement: Databases enforce constraints to maintain consistency automatically.

ACID in NoSQL Databases
While ACID properties are foundational to RDBMS, NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra often sacrifice some ACID properties for performance and scalability. However, many NoSQL databases provide configurable levels of ACID compliance or specific ACID-compliant features.

Real-World Applications of ACID Transactions
ACID transactions are used in various real-world applications, including:

Banking Systems: Ensures that financial transactions are secure and reliable.

E-commerce Platforms: Guarantees that orders are processed accurately and securely.

Healthcare Systems: Ensures that patient data is accurate and secure.

ACID transactions are a fundamental concept in database management systems that ensure data integrity, reliability, and consistency.

By understanding and leveraging ACID transactions, developers can create database systems that are reliable, consistent, and capable of handling concurrent access and failures.
