## Introduction

Amazon's phone screen combines **technical** and **behavioral questions**. This updated guide provides an extensive roadmap, incorporating new resources and key insights for a thorough preparation.

**Key Goals:**
- Master system design fundamentals using resources like [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).
- Develop strong coding and problem-solving skills.
- Demonstrate Amazonâ€™s leadership principles during behavioral discussions.

## System Design

### Core Concepts
- Detailed breakdown of [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) concepts:
  - Scalability, Availability, Load Balancing, Data Partitioning.
  - Asynchronous processing, Event-driven architecture.
- Databases and Storage Systems:
  - SQL vs. NoSQL, Indexing, Sharding, Replication.
- Networking: DNS, TLS, HTTP/HTTPS.
- Caching Strategies (Redis, Memcached).
- Microservices and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- CAP Theorem and its implications.
- Consistent Hashing.
- Data Consistency and Consensus (Paxos, Raft).

### Key Design Patterns
- Rate limiting, Leader election, Service discovery.
- Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, Backpressure.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).
- Event Sourcing.
