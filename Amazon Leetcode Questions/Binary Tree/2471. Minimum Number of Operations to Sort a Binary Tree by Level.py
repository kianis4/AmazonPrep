# Runtime Complexity Analysis:
# - `bfs`: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
# - `minimum_swaps`: O(k log k + k), where k is the number of nodes at a given level. Sorting takes O(k log k), and visiting all elements for cycle detection takes O(k).
# - Overall: O(n + Σ(k log k)), which simplifies to O(n log k) in the worst case.

# Space Complexity Analysis:
# - `bfs`: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the binary tree (number of nodes at the largest level).
# - `minimum_swaps`: O(k) for the visited array and the sorted positions array.
# - Overall: O(w + k) ≈ O(n) in the worst case.
