**Action**: I built an **AWS Lambda function** integrated with SNS and S3. The function automatically triggered review requests after specific client interactions, removing the need for manual intervention. I also added error handling and logging to ensure reliability.  
**Result**: The invention reduced manual follow-up efforts by **70%**, improved client review engagement, and allowed the team to focus on higher-priority tasks.

---

### **Question 3**: Tell me about a time when you tried to simplify a process but failed. What would you have done differently?

**Answer**:  
**Situation**: During my internship at **SDI Labs**, I attempted to simplify the data scraping workflows by combining all scripts into a single monolithic program. My goal was to make maintenance easier and reduce the number of processes running.  
**Task**: I wanted to unify the web scraping tools to improve code organization and operational efficiency.  
**Action**: I refactored the existing scrapers into a single script. However, this introduced unintended dependencies, and one script failure caused the entire process to fail. Additionally, performance declined because the unified script could no longer run tasks concurrently.  
**Result**: The project did not meet expectations, and I had to revert to the previous modular design.  

**What I Would Have Done Differently**:  
I learned the importance of balancing simplicity with functionality. In the future, I would test incremental changes rather than fully overhauling a working system. I would also leverage containerization tools like **Docker** to maintain modularity while achieving the desired organizational improvements.

**Task**: I needed to improve query performance without clear insights into existing schemas or bottlenecks.  
**Action**: I conducted thorough profiling using tools like `EXPLAIN` to analyze query execution plans. Through trial and error, I identified inefficient queries, restructured database indexes, and optimized the query patterns. Additionally, I documented my findings for future team members.  
**Result**: Query execution times were reduced by **20%**, and the database performance became more predictable and scalable, saving time for future developers.

---

### **Question 3**: Tell me about a time when you were wrong.

**Answer**:  
**Situation**: At **SKompXcel**, I initially believed that automating all administrative workflows using Google Cloud tools would immediately improve the platform's scalability and performance.  
**Task**: I began migrating the workflows without fully analyzing the bottlenecks or prioritizing the areas where automation would have the most impact.  
**Action**: Midway through the process, I realized that certain manual steps, such as student progress tracking, were still necessary for personalized learning. Automating everything too quickly created unnecessary complexity. I paused, revisited my approach, and prioritized automating repetitive tasks like scheduling and notifications while retaining manual oversight for student tracking.  
**Result**: By refining the focus of automation, I improved platform reliability, reduced scheduling errors by **30%**, and enhanced the student experience. This experience taught me to evaluate solutions thoroughly before committing to large-scale changes.
