## 1. **Customer Obsession**

### **Question 1**: Who was your most difficult customer?  

**Answer**:  
**Situation**: At **SKompXcel**, I encountered a student who was highly skeptical of the tutoring process. They were frustrated due to poor experiences with previous tutors and were initially uncooperative during sessions.  
**Task**: I needed to rebuild their trust, ensure they engaged with the sessions, and demonstrate the value of my approach.  
**Action**: I started by listening to their concerns and tailored the tutoring sessions to their preferred learning style. I introduced practical examples and real-world problem-solving to make the content more relatable. I also checked in regularly to address any lingering doubts and maintained open, supportive communication.  
**Result**: Over time, the student became more receptive and started to enjoy the sessions. They improved their grades significantly, and by the end, they shared positive feedback about my teaching style and efforts.  

---

### **Question 2**: Tell me about a time when you didn't meet customer expectations. What happened, and how did you deal with the situation?  

**Answer**:  
**Situation**: At **SKompXcel**, a student expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of the tutoring sessions, feeling overwhelmed by the content.  
**Task**: I needed to address the student's concerns, adjust the content delivery, and ensure their success without compromising quality.  
**Action**: I met with the student to understand their struggles and implemented a personalized plan, breaking down complex topics into smaller, manageable parts. I also created a progress-tracking system to measure their understanding at each stage.  
**Result**: The student regained confidence, achieved their learning goals, and ultimately performed well in their exams.  

---

### **Question 3**: How do you go about prioritizing customer needs when you are dealing with a large number of customers?  

**Answer**:  
**Situation**: At **SKompXcel**, I often had to manage multiple students simultaneously, each with different learning goals, deadlines, and areas of difficulty. Balancing priorities was challenging, as all students required attention.  
**Task**: I needed to effectively prioritize their needs while ensuring no student felt overlooked.  
**Action**: I developed a structured system to triage priorities based on urgency and complexity. For example:  
- I scheduled students with immediate deadlines for early sessions.  
- I dedicated extra time to students struggling with foundational concepts, as their progress would impact future sessions.  
- I created a shared calendar for transparent scheduling and communicated session plans in advance to manage expectations.  

I also established office hours where students could drop in for quick clarifications, minimizing bottlenecks.  
**Result**: This approach enabled me to balance the needs of all students effectively. By prioritizing based on urgency and individual progress, I ensured every student received the support they needed. Feedback improved, and students achieved higher success rates.

**Action**: I built an **AWS Lambda function** integrated with SNS and S3. The function automatically triggered review requests after specific client interactions, removing the need for manual intervention. I also added error handling and logging to ensure reliability.  
**Result**: The invention reduced manual follow-up efforts by **70%**, improved client review engagement, and allowed the team to focus on higher-priority tasks.

---

### **Question 3**: Tell me about a time when you tried to simplify a process but failed. What would you have done differently?

**Answer**:  
**Situation**: During my internship at **SDI Labs**, I attempted to simplify the data scraping workflows by combining all scripts into a single monolithic program. My goal was to make maintenance easier and reduce the number of processes running.  
**Task**: I wanted to unify the web scraping tools to improve code organization and operational efficiency.  
**Action**: I refactored the existing scrapers into a single script. However, this introduced unintended dependencies, and one script failure caused the entire process to fail. Additionally, performance declined because the unified script could no longer run tasks concurrently.  
**Result**: The project did not meet expectations, and I had to revert to the previous modular design.  

**What I Would Have Done Differently**:  
I learned the importance of balancing simplicity with functionality. In the future, I would test incremental changes rather than fully overhauling a working system. I would also leverage containerization tools like **Docker** to maintain modularity while achieving the desired organizational improvements.

**Task**: I needed to improve query performance without clear insights into existing schemas or bottlenecks.  
**Action**: I conducted thorough profiling using tools like `EXPLAIN` to analyze query execution plans. Through trial and error, I identified inefficient queries, restructured database indexes, and optimized the query patterns. Additionally, I documented my findings for future team members.  
**Result**: Query execution times were reduced by **20%**, and the database performance became more predictable and scalable, saving time for future developers.

---

### **Question 3**: Tell me about a time when you were wrong.

**Answer**:  
**Situation**: At **SKompXcel**, I initially believed that automating all administrative workflows using Google Cloud tools would immediately improve the platform's scalability and performance.  
**Task**: I began migrating the workflows without fully analyzing the bottlenecks or prioritizing the areas where automation would have the most impact.  
**Action**: Midway through the process, I realized that certain manual steps, such as student progress tracking, were still necessary for personalized learning. Automating everything too quickly created unnecessary complexity. I paused, revisited my approach, and prioritized automating repetitive tasks like scheduling and notifications while retaining manual oversight for student tracking.  
**Result**: By refining the focus of automation, I improved platform reliability, reduced scheduling errors by **30%**, and enhanced the student experience. This experience taught me to evaluate solutions thoroughly before committing to large-scale changes.
