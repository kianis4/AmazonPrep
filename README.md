## **Amazon Online Assessment (OA) Breakdown**

The OA consists of four parts:
1. **Coding Assessment** (70 minutes): Solve two problems. 
   - Focus on algorithms and data structures.
   - Allowed to use public online resources (e.g., Java API), but no login-required or private sources.

2. **Workstyles Assessment** (15 minutes): Select statements that best align with your work style.
   - No preparation needed; answers should reflect Amazon‚Äôs Leadership Principles.

3. **Work Simulation** (60 minutes): Interactive tasks simulating a day in the life of an SDE.
   - Requires prioritization, decision-making, and problem-solving aligned with Amazon‚Äôs values.

4. **Feedback Survey** (5 minutes): Share your experience.

**Important Notes**:
- Use a webcam and have ID ready.
- Complete all sections in one sitting.
- Deadlines are strict; plan accordingly.

|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Arrays**              | Sliding window, prefix sum, sorting                      | Two Sum, Maximum Subarray, Merge Intervals |
| **Strings**             | Substrings, pattern matching, anagrams                   | Longest Substring Without Repeating Chars  |
| **Hashmaps**            | Frequency counts, lookups                                | Group Anagrams, Longest Consecutive Sequence |
| **Linked Lists**        | Fast/slow pointers, reversing, merging                   | Merge Two Sorted Lists, Detect Cycle       |
| **Binary Search**       | Divide and conquer, rotated arrays                       | Search in Rotated Sorted Array             |
| **Trees and Graphs**    | BFS, DFS, recursion                                      | Lowest Common Ancestor, Number of Islands  |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Subproblems, memoization                                 | House Robber, Longest Palindromic Substring |

## **Work Simulation and Workstyles Assessment**

### **Work Simulation**
- Practice prioritizing tasks aligned with customer obsession.
- Mock scenario:
  - **Task**: Balancing team timelines with customer expectations.
  - **Options**: Evaluate trade-offs and align with Amazon‚Äôs values.

### **Workstyles Assessment**
- Familiarize yourself with statements tied to leadership principles.
- Example question: ‚ÄúI prefer to dive into the details of a problem‚Äù (aligned with **Dive Deep**).
